Hi, I'm Kerry Bailey and I'm a pole and
flexibility instructor.

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.840
I've been teaching now for six years.

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.450
It's just something that gives me such a
buzz and I just want to share my passion and

4
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.060
enthusiasm. My favorite thing about teaching
Stretch and Pole is showing people what their

5
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.410
bodies are capable of.

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.780
The excitement for me is those sudden
realization moments for my students when they

7
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.010
come in and say to me, I never thought I'd
be able to do that.

8
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.100
They get that spark and that buzz and it
drives them to keep going.

9
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.030
There are so many benefits for stretching.

10
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.490
And it's not just about how flexible can I
get, but it's also about that strength as

11
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.530
well. This is something that can often be
overlooked.

12
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.360
It's something I'm really passionate about
because it prevents injury.

13
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.560
It gives you those abilities to further the
sport that you're in.

14
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.480
So if you're new to stretching and you're
about to start your journey, please just

15
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.860
enjoy the process.

16
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.300
It might feel a little bit unusual for you
to start with, but as long as you're paying

17
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.100
attention to your body and keeping good
form, you're going to enjoy this process and

18
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.740
you're going to be surprised at what your
body can achieve.
